# SDL Game Engine Template

This project is a really quick template for a basic SDL game engine. It provides basic utilities for manipulating and performing graphics operations.

## 2D

Currently 2D portions are located in the `winengine::2D` namespace.

This namespace is designed specifically for 2D games. It implements generic data structures that are applicable to both game engine types.

## 3D

Currently 3D portions are located in the `winengine::3D` namespace.

3D Functions have not yet been implemented.
