# SDL Game Engine Template

This project is a really quick template for a basic SDL game engine. It provides basic utilities for manipulating and performing graphics operations in 2D.

## 2D

Currently 2D portions are located in the `weng::` namespace.

This namespace is designed specifically for 2D games. It implements generic data structures that are applicable to both game engine types.

## How do

1. Install SDL libraries

2. `make`
